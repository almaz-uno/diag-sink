= Diagnostic sink

Just simple tool for receiving the debug events and redirects them to the file (or pipe, if any).

== Building

. link:https://go.dev/doc/install[Download and install Go v1.21 or above]
. Run `go build` from inside root directory. Please, look at build.bash file for example.
. Use building results

== Running

Just run `diag-sink -h` to investigate CLI options.

== Using

The application exposes the only `POST /sink` endpoint. Special thanks to creators link:https://github.com/labstack/echo[labstack/echo] library.

The application copies body stream to the `output` file followed by `\n`. The output file is been opening and closing each writing to it. So, it can be moved between writings.

Enjoy.
